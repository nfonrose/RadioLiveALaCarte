### ----------------------------
I want you to initiate this Java project which should be built with Gradle 7.6.3 with:

- an EntryPoint class called `com.prtlabs.rlalc.backend.services.mediacapture.EntryPoint.java` which calls a service instanciated via Google Guice, called RLALCMediaCaptureService.

- The RLALCMediaCaptureService should be in package `com.prtlabs.rlalc.backend.services.mediacapture` and should have a single method called start which display a simple "Hello world" message.

The application will use Google Guice and  SLF4F with LogBack for logging.


### ----------------------------
Update the project to Java 21 and Guice 7.0.0 please
